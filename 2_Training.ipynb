    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",

    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    For the encoder CNN , I haven't changed the provided architecture . ResNet-50 would do the job for analyzing the spatial features in the image and extracting them . Followed by an embedding layer to unroll the extracted features into a feacture vector of a specific length to feed the first step in the decoder RNN .\n",
    "        \n",
    "    For the decoder RNN , I used an embedding layer for the input captions to have every token to be a vector of size equal to hidden_size , like spatial feature vector . Followed by an lstm of one hidden layer . Following , a fully connected layer to turn the output prediction of lstm , which has a size equal to hidden layer size , into a vector of length equal to length of vocabulary , for each token in the input to the FC layer . \n",
    "    I have checked the paper recommended for this project , but I couldn't find the specific RNN architecture in it\n",
    "    For selecting variables of taks 1 :\n",
    "        * batch_size : 32 : Wouldn't probably exceed GPU memory , is good for generalizing and not be affected by noise in a single example , isn't too large and this makes some room for noise to help overcome local minima if it gets stuck into . \n",
    "        * vocab_threshold : 4 : If a word appears in dataset less than this number , it must be a very rare or special word in a specific , like a name for example , that's not worth adding to dataset and increasing perplexity\n",
    "        * vocab_from_file : True : to save time , vocab was created once and saved to file , then used over again from file\n",
    "        * embed_size : 512 : Typical from the example RNN architectures of the hyperparameters lesson in tutorial 8 and thinking it's enough to express the spatial features in the image .\n",
    "        * hidden_size : 512 : Also from the example RNN architectures of the hyperparameters lesson in tutorial 8 \n",
    "        * num_epochs : 1 : to validate that the model is actually learning with no errors . Also learning takes some time and I prefer to monitor it and iteratively tune parameters or make sure of model and testing it .\n",
    "        * save_every : 1 : since an epoch takes long time , I save every epoch so as not to lose any progress \n",
    "        * print_every : 100 : to be able to monitor learning progress without waiting for long to detect if there's a problem with the learning process\n",
    "        \n",
    "        In the forward function , I had an issue with how the input should look like . I googled it and found this article and it gave me idea of how to combine the spatial features extracted from the image with the provided captions of image \n",

    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "    \n",
    "    I prefered not to modify it . It's good enough in my opinion . Fixed image size , randomness in cropping and flipping help generalize over examples . To tensor is a must to work with model , and normalization of image helps model learn faster and better , and helps against exploding gradient . Maybe random rotation can be added too , but I'll first try the provided transform as is and see if it later needs modification\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    All parameters of the RNN decoder need training . It was created with no pretraining of any task . \n",
    "    Also , the final fully connected layer in the encoder CNN also needs traing for same reason .\n",
    "    Only the ResNet block doesn't need training since it's already pretrained and has good performance in feature extraction .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Adam optimizer is a good and common optimizer . It provides momentum factor and decay factor . Momentum helps the model to be more robust to noises in different batches . Decay is used to make learning rate less and less while training since we need to do this as we are getting closer to convergence point to avoid overshooting . Actually I choose it for all my models rather than tailoring an optimizer for every specific model as I haven't passed through I project where I needed to change it , yet ."

    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
